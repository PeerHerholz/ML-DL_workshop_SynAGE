# Outline

The [overview]() already specified it, but just to be sure: the workshop will be split
into two distinct parts. While the first half (and few hours) will consist of going through
the theoretical background of "classic" machine learning and deep learning, the second half 
will entail a dedicated hands-on session within which folks will evaluate the discussed topics
and their feasibility for their own data. As mentioned before, these resources will only contain
the materials for the first part, as the second will include work on data brought by the workshop
attendees. In general, we will aim for 2 h per block, that is 2 h for "classic" machine learning and
2 h for deep learning. Within each we will go from basic concepts and building blocks to model evaluations
and important problems. Our **very optimistic** schedule looks as follows (all times in EST):
