# Welcome!

Hello everyone and welcome to the "A primer ML/DL with a focus on Neuroscience" workshop\
conducted during the [RTG 2413 SynAGE summer school](https://www.synage.de/synage-summer-school/), we're glad to see you here!

Within these pages, we provide information on how to follow the workshop, as well as respective materials. This [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) will include the used slides and code in a way that they can be explored in an interactive manner. You can navigate through the respective sections via the TOC on the left side and within sections via the TOC on the right side. The three symbols in the top allow to enable full screen mode, link to the underlying [Github repository](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE) and allow you to download the contents as a pdf or jupyter notebook respectively. Some sections will additionally have a little rocket in that row which will allow you to interactively rerun certain analyses via cloud computing. Additionally, we support public reviews and comments through an [hypothes.is plugin](https://web.hypothes.is/) with which you can interact on the right side. All of this awesomeness (talking about the infrastructure and resource) is possible through the dedicated and second to none work of the [Jupyter community](https://jupyter.org/community), specifically, the [Executable/Jupyter Book](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/) and [mybinder project](https://mybinder.org/).

# A primer on ML/DL with a focus on Neuroscience

Throughout the last couple of years, ML and DL become exponentially more and more prominent within the majority of 
research fields. Neuroscience is no exception to that, as things like personalized medicine, image/data processing and 
the combination of biological and artificial neural networks are treated as central research questions. However, what's
actually behind all these buzzwords? Is ML and DL really necessary in the majority of cases? Can they actually applied
to any kind of data and help solve distinct problems? Within this workshop which was organized as part of the [SynAGE 2021 summer school](https://www.synage.de/synage-summer-school/),
we will introduce and discuss important aspects of these methods and evaluate their usability, as well as potential application to research
projects of the attendees. While the first, rather theoretical part will be publicly shared here, the application focused part won't as this
will include datasets of the attendees.    

You can checkout the respective sections:

* [An overview]()

   What's this workshop about and how is it organized?

* [Setup]()

   How are things implemented and supposed to work?

* [General outline]()

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Prerequisites]()

   All things gotta start somewhere and ML/DL are of course no exceptions to
   that, especially since a certain amount of digital literacy, programming, etc. is required. 
   Here, we gathered some resources folks can check out in preparation for the course or just for fun.

* [Machine learning]()

   Within the first part of the workshop, we will focus on "classical" machine learning. But what is it
   actually and what are important aspects folks should know about?

* [Deep learning]()

   Naturally, the complexity of algorithms regarding data processing scales up and within that, the application
   of deep learning in the field of neuroscience became more and more prominent. Here, we're going to dive a bit
   into central questions like: is it really AI, how does it work and can I apply it to my data?

* [Feedback]()

   How did attendees like the course? Here we will publicly provide the feedback we received.

* [Code of Conduct](https://g0rella.github.io/gorella_overview/CoC.html)

   Necessities for creating an open, fair, safe and inclusive learning
   experience.

# I've got a question!

In case you have any questions or difficulties going through the workshop, please don’t hesitate a single second to get in touch with
us. A great way to do this is to
[open an issue](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE/issue) on the
[GitHub site of the Workshop](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE) (also possible via the GitHub button at the top of the pages).
We would also highly appreciate and value every feedback or idea or you
might have (via [issues](https://github.com/PeerHerholz/ML-DL_workshop_SynAGE) or [hypothes.is annotation feature](https://web.hypothes.is/) on the right).
